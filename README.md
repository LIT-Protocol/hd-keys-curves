# hd-keys-ecdsa
A proof of concept for implementing HD keys with Cait-Sith.

The HD key derivation scheme is based on [On the security of ECDSA with additive key derivation and
presignatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1330.pdf) and [Design and analysis of a distributed ECDSA signing service](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/506.pdf)
